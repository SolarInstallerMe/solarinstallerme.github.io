**Understanding the Pros and Cons of DIY Solar Installation:** People choose to use solar energy for a variety of reasons. Some people desire to convert to renewable and clean energy. Others are in favor of lessening their dependency on the power grid.

But financial savings are the main incentive for going solar. More than any other reason, 96% of individuals who have installed or will install solar do so to reduce their power costs.

Using a reputable solar firm is now entirely feasible; after all, that is how the majority of people go solar. However, you might want to think about a do-it-yourself (DIY) installation if you want to minimize your upfront expenditures as much as possible. After all, doing things yourself is less expensive than having someone else do them for you.

## **What are the pros and cons of a do-it-yourself solar installation?**

Even while DIY solar is less expensive than using a reputable solar company, it is still a significant investment. Before investing too much time and money into the process, you should decide if a DIY solar panel installation is the right choice for you.

The following list of potential pros and cons will help you choose whether DIY solar is worthwhile for you:

## **Cons of DIY solar panels**

### **Roof damage or leak risk**

When it comes to a do-it-yourself solar installation, this is possibly the largest financial risk.

Your solar system will need drilling several holes through your roof unless it is level. While improper sealing and flashing might result in roof leaks and/or mold problems, drilling into the wrong area on the roof can harm the structure.

Another thing to bear in mind is that a DIY solar installation is likely to invalidate your roof’s warranty, so you’ll be responsible for paying for any necessary repairs.

### **It takes a lot of work and time.**

[Solar panel installation](/top-benefits-of-installing-solar-panels-on-your-home/) is beneficial, but only if you’re deliberately looking for a significant DIY project.

However, you might want to avoid taking on solar if your prior DIY knowledge is limited to assembling flat-pack furniture. A DIY solar installation typically takes between one and four months to complete from conception to commissioning, so it not only demands a lot of planning and organizing abilities but also requires a lot of time.

### **Physical risk**

Installing DIY solar panels on their own run the danger of falling and being shocked by high voltage electricity.

The physical dangers extend beyond the installation as well. Over the course of the panels’ 25-year lifespan, you will be responsible for returning to the roof to address any issues that may arise.

The rooftop system might catch fire if the wiring is improperly connected, which is the worst-case scenario!

### **Unable to claim certain incentives**

Many states provide rebates and incentives that significantly lower the cost of going solar.

However, certain incentives are only accessible if the installation is carried out by a licensed solar provider. Make careful to find out what discounts and incentives are offered where you reside.

### **No assistance with defects or warranty claims**

If there is ever a problem with the equipment, you are on your own.

Of course, you may still get in touch with the manufacturer directly, but proving a warranty claim might be challenging. Additionally, if the installation is done incorrectly, the guarantee may be void.

## **Pros of DIY solar panels**

### **DIY fulfillment**

If you prefer doing challenging and substantial DIY projects, a solar installation could be just what you’re looking for.

Among the skill sets, you’ll need to employ are tax accounting, financial planning, power tool proficiency, understanding of municipal procedures, and electrical and financial planning.

Planning, obtaining, requesting permits, installing, wiring, and monitoring are other processes in the solar installation process.

This project will keep you occupied for a long, and if you manage to do it on your own, you’ll surely feel pleased with your accomplishment.

### **Cost Saving**

Homeowners may avoid paying upfront [installation cost](/factors-that-affect-your-total-solar-panel-installation-cost/) of thousands of dollars by installing solar panels themselves.

A reputable solar company will install solar panels at about $2.95 per watt on average. That comes out to $14,750 for a standard 5 kW (5,000 watts) solar panel setup.

A 5 kW DIY solar panel kit, however, costs between $1.00 and $1.50 per watt. A 5 kW DIY solar installation will cost between $5,000 and $7,500 if you do every aspect of the work yourself (i.e., no outside help for any of the jobs).

This translates to a possible savings of $7,250 to $9,759 when a DIY solar installation is chosen over a professional installation.

Numerous factors, such as the size of your system and whether you are eligible for the solar tax credit (worth 26% of the cost of a solar energy system in 2022) might alter these figures for you. check our [free solar calculator](/[solar-quote-form](/calculator/) to see what solar that fits your needs
