**Are Solar Panels Covered by Home Insurance?:** If you’re looking for a means to produce electricity while also saving money, solar panels are a wonderful investment. You’ll also want to safeguard your solar panel installation, just like you would any other investment.

How do you then protect your solar panels? Is it possible to buy insurance for solar panels?

The good news is that your home insurance may provide coverage. Read on to discover more.

### **Does Home Insurance Cover Solar Panels?**

Your house insurance may in fact provide coverage for your solar panels.

Your solar panels will be covered by the dwelling section of your homeowners insurance as long as they are affixed to your house. However, you will only get compensated if a covered risk results in damage to your panels.

### **Covered Perils**

The kinds of harm that your homeowner’s insurance will pay for are known as covered dangers. Your homeowners insurance may pay for the repair or replacement of your solar panels, for instance, if they are damaged by a fire or hail.

You’ll need to get a different policy to safeguard your panels from wear and tear, flooding, or an earthquake because your coverage probably won’t cover damage from these occurrences.

To make sure that your panels have the coverage they require in the event of an incident, be sure to review your insurance and speak with your insurer.

### **Does Housing Insurance Go Up With Solar Panels?**

Your homeowner’s insurance may become more expensive as a result of your solar panels. And because solar panels raise the value of your home, your insurance policy premiums rise.

To sufficiently cover the home in the event of a covered accident, homeowner insurance often bases its premiums on the value of the house. As a result, you will need to increase your insurance coverage to reflect the rise in the value of your property.

### **Getting an Additional Insurance Policy for Solar Panels**

In some cases, you’ll need to purchase separate insurance or add more coverage to protect your solar panels. For instance, if your solar panel system is not put on the roof of your home but rather is mounted on the ground in your yard, on a wall, or on a carport, you will require a different policy.

Your homeowners insurance will provide coverage for solar panels that are permanently fixed to your home. To find out the best course of action, speak with your insurance agent as each insurer handles its policies differently.

### **House Insurance Effects OF Leasing Solar Panels**

Fortunately, if you wish to start using the solar energy but lack the initial expenditure to make a purchase, you have the option to lease solar panels. If you wish to [install a solar](/things-to-know-before-installing-solar-panels-on-your-home/) power system, several solar energy companies give you the option to lease their panels. Depending on the business you choose to collaborate with, this option has low to no upfront expenditures.

Because you don’t own leased solar panels, you normally don’t need to buy insurance for them. To find out if they offer insurance over them in the event of a chance accident or weather-related disaster, you must contact your [solar companies](/solar/).

Some businesses could demand that you buy your own coverage over the panels. Once more, be sure to discuss this issue with your solar energy provider.

### **Cost of Solar Panel Insurance**

The cost of insurance for solar energy systems that are attached to your home is normally included in your homeowner’s coverage because they are regarded as permanent attachments. When you install these panels, your policy’s coverage limit will alter.

Especially if the solar panels sustain serious damage, you’ll want to be sure that your insurance coverage is large enough to cover both the damage to your home and the damage to the solar panels. You could even want to include the full replacement cost of your system in your overall coverage limit.

The cost of a household solar energy system varies by state, with average prices between $8,000 and $15,000. Since this will greatly boost the value of your home, you should raise the limit of your homeowner’s insurance coverage.

However, increasing your coverage level shouldn’t have a substantial impact on your premium.

### **Damaged Roof From Installation**

If you don’t engage with qualified and competent solar installation teams, installing solar panel systems on your roof could potentially cause damage. Your homeowner’s insurance may not cover damage to your house caused by a contractor, so you may have to pay for the repairs out of pocket.

Contacting your insurer is the only way to find out if your damages are covered. They will inform you if the harm in question falls within a covered risk. However, if you decide to work with a competent installation crew, they will make sure that your roof is not harmed in any way while installation is taking place.

Be sure to read customer reviews before choosing a contractor. You can get a better understanding of what clients liked and disliked about their services through this. Before beginning any project, you should request to see your contractor’s licenses and proof of insurance. If your home’s insurance declines to pay for harm resulting from a contractor’s solar installation, this will provide you with backup coverage.
