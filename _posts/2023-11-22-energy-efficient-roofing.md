Energy-efficient roofing is a smart investment for homeowners who want to save money on their energy bills and reduce their carbon footprint. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of energy-efficient roofing and how it can help you create a more comfortable and sustainable home.

## What is Energy-Efficient Roofing?

Energy-efficient roofing is designed to reduce the amount of heat that is absorbed by your home. This is achieved by using materials that reflect sunlight and heat away from your roof, rather than absorbing it. Energy-efficient roofing can be made from a variety of materials, including metal, asphalt shingles, shake shingles, and tile roofing. By reducing the amount of heat that is absorbed by your home, energy-efficient roofing can help you save money on your energy bills and reduce your carbon footprint.
