[Solar panels](/solar-panel-types/) stand as an exceptional source of clean energy, yet their vulnerability to diverse weather conditions, particularly hailstorms, sparks apprehension regarding their durability. In this piece, we explore the potential repercussions of hail on solar panels, delving into their resilience, protective strategies, and the aftermath of hailstorms. Join us on this exploration with the central question in mind: **_Can hail_ damage solar panels_?_** Embark on this journey to unveil the intricacies of preserving your solar investment in the face of the unpredictable forces of nature.

## Understanding Solar Panels and Hailstorms

### How do solar panels work?

Before delving into the potential impact of hail, let's first understand [how solar panels work](/how-do-solar-panels-work/). Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells. The photovoltaic cells absorb sunlight, generating direct current (DC) electricity, and then convert it into usable alternating current (AC) electricity for your home.

## Can hail damage solar panels?

The question of whether hail can damage solar panels is a valid concern for those considering solar energy. Let's explore the factors that contribute to the resilience of solar panels against hailstorms.

### Photovoltaic Panel Resilience to Hail

Solar panels, including hail-resistant features, withstand various weather conditions. Factors influencing the resilience of photovoltaic panels to hail include the [materials used](/how-are-solar-panels-made/), the thickness of the glass covering the solar cells, and the [installation angle](/optimal-solar-angle/). Manufacturers often equip high-quality solar panels with tempered glass, creating a protective barrier against hailstones.

### Hail Protection for Solar Installations

To enhance the durability of solar installations, manufacturers may incorporate hail protection measures. This can include impact-resistant glass coatings and sturdy framing to minimize the risk of damage during hailstorms.

## Assessing Hail Damage on Solar Cells

Despite the built-in resilience of solar panels, it's essential to assess any potential hail damage on solar cells after a severe weather event. Here are key steps to consider:

1. **Visual Inspection:** Conduct a visual inspection of the solar panels to identify any visible cracks, chips, or indentations caused by hailstones.

3. **Professional Evaluation:** It's advisable to hire a [qualified solar technician](/) to assess the extent of damage. They can conduct a thorough examination and determine whether repairs or replacements are necessary.
