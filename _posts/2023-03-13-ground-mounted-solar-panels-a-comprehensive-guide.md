Are you considering[ installing solar panels](https://solarinstaller.me/thing-you-need-to-know-solar-installation/) on your property but don't have enough roof space? Ground-mounted solar panels are an excellent alternative that can provide you with the energy savings you need. In this comprehensive guide, we will cover everything you need to know about ground-mounted solar panels.



## What are Ground Mounted Solar Panels?

Ground-mounted solar panels are solar panels that are installed on the ground instead of on the roof of a building. They are typically installed on a concrete or metal foundation and tilted at an angle to optimize their exposure to the sun. Ground-mounted solar panels are an excellent alternative to roof-mounted solar panels when there is limited roof space, or the roof is not suitable for solar panel installation.



## Advantages of Ground Mounted Solar Panels

There are several advantages of ground-mounted solar panels over roof-mounted solar panels. Some of these advantages include:



### More Energy Production

Ground-mounted solar panels can produce more energy compared to roof-mounted solar panels because they are not limited by the size of the roof. Ground-mounted solar panels can be sized according to the homeowner's energy needs, and the panels can be tilted at an angle that optimizes their exposure to the sun.

### Easy Maintenance

Ground-mounted solar panels are easier to maintain compared to roof-mounted solar panels. They are easily accessible, and maintenance work can be done without the need for special equipment.

### Flexibility

Ground-mounted solar panels can be installed in any location on the property, as long as there is enough space and sunlight. This means that the homeowner has more flexibility in choosing the location of the solar panel installation.

## Disadvantages of Ground Mounted Solar Panels

While there are many advantages to ground-mounted solar panels, there are also some disadvantages. Some of these disadvantages include:



### Higher Installation Cost

Ground-mounted solar panels have a higher installation cost compared to roof-mounted solar panels. This is because the installation process is more complex and requires more materials.

### Space Requirements

Ground-mounted solar panels require more space compared to roof-mounted solar panels. This means that not all properties are suitable for ground-mounted solar panel installation.

### Aesthetics

Ground-mounted solar panels can be more visible compared to roof-mounted solar panels. This can be a concern for homeowners who are concerned about the aesthetics of their property.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing Ground Mounted Solar Panels

There are several factors that you need to consider when choosing ground-mounted solar panels for your property. These factors include:



### Available Space

The amount of space you have available on your property will determine the size of the solar panel system you can install. You should measure the available space and ensure that it is adequate for the solar panel system you want to install.

### Sun Exposure

Ground-mounted solar panels require adequate sunlight to generate electricity. You should ensure that the location where you want to install the solar panels has enough sun exposure to make the installation worthwhile.

### Orientation

The orientation of the solar panel system is critical to its performance. You should ensure that the solar panel system is oriented towards the sun to maximize its exposure.

### Tilt Angle

The tilt angle of the solar panel system is also essential to its performance. The tilt angle should be optimized to maximize the system's exposure to the sun.

### Cost

The cost of the solar panel system is an essential consideration when choosing ground-mounted solar panels. You should compare the cost of different systems and choose the one that best fits your budget.





## Installation Process for Ground Mounted Solar Panels

The installation process for ground-mounted solar panels is more complex compared to roof-mounted solar panels. The following are the steps involved in installing ground-mounted solar panels:

### Site Assessment

A site assessment is done to determine the suitability of the property for solar panel installation. The assessment takes into account factors such as the available space, sun exposure, and orientation of the property.

the available space, sun exposure, and orientation of the property.

### Design and Permitting

After the site assessment, the solar panel system is designed, and the necessary permits are obtained. The design takes into account the energy needs of the homeowner and the available space.

### Foundation Installation

The foundation for the solar panel system is installed, which can be made of concrete or metal. The foundation is designed to support the weight of the solar panel system and keep it stable.

### Racking Installation

The racking system is installed on the foundation. The racking system is designed to support the solar panels and keep them tilted at the correct angle.

### Panel Installation

The solar panels are installed on the racking system. The panels are wired together to create a complete solar panel system.

### Electrical Connection

The solar panel system is connected to the electrical system of the property. This allows the energy produced by the solar panel system to be used by the homeowner.





## Maintenance of Ground Mounted Solar Panels

Ground-mounted solar panels require minimal maintenance compared to roof-mounted solar panels. However, it is still essential to perform regular maintenance to ensure that the solar panel system is operating at maximum efficiency. Some maintenance tasks that need to be done include:

### Cleaning

The solar panels should be cleaned regularly to remove any dirt or debris that can reduce their efficiency.

### Inspection

Regular inspections should be done to check for any damage or wear on the solar panel system.

### Repair

Any damage or wear on the solar panel system should be repaired as soon as possible to prevent further damage.

## Conclusion

Ground-mounted solar panels are an excellent alternative to roof-mounted solar panels. They offer more energy production, easy maintenance, and flexibility in installation location. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as higher installation costs and space requirements. When choosing ground-mounted solar panels, it is essential to consider factors such as available space, sun exposure, orientation, tilt angle, and cost.

## FAQs
