**How Do I Calculate How Many Solar Panels I Need?:** How many solar panels to put in is one of the most crucial choices you’ll have to make when establishing a solar energy system. Your ability to generate power will be greatly influenced by the number of solar panels you have installed, so your choice will have an impact on both your ability to reduce your electric bill and your return on investment.

Fortunately, you don’t have to make this choice by yourself. Our Solar Providers can choose the ideal quantity of solar panels for your residential or commercial solar installation and install custom [solar designs for businesses](/commercial-solar-panel-installation-step-by-step/) and homes.

## **Factors That Will Determine How Many Solar Panels You Need**

With about 20–25 solar panels, the majority of average-sized homes with average electricity usage can cover their energy requirements. However, this figure is only an approximation. Take into account the following elements to determine the number of solar panels your home or business will require:

### **Goals for Solar Energy**

Setting goals is essential before going solar. Do you desire a solar system that can provide all of your energy needs? Do you place more importance on saving money than the environment? It will be considerably simpler to size your solar panels if you are aware of your objectives.

### **How Much Electricity You Use**

Before deciding how many solar panels to install, you must first determine how much electricity you use in order for your [solar panels to fully offset](/how-to-offset-your-energy-cost-use-with-solar/) it. Reviewing your electric bills from the last 12 months will provide you with this data.

Don’t forget to factor future increases into your annual electricity usage [calculations](/solar-calculator/). Consider how much more energy you will use, for instance, if you decide to install a swimming pool or a station for charging electric cars.

### **The efficiency of Solar Panel**

How effectively a solar panel can transform sunlight into electricity is described by its solar panel efficiency. Not all solar panels are created equal; higher-quality panels typically have efficiency ratings that are greater. A solar panel with higher efficiency will probably cost more than one with lower efficiency, but it will generate more electricity. As a result, you can produce more electricity with fewer solar panels, which can lower the initial cost of installation.

### **How Big Your Roof Is**

Size might be a limiting factor when installing solar panels on rooftops. The amount of useable roof space you have depends on how many solar panels you can put. Most of the time, a unique solar panel design can overcome spacing issues and provide you with the right amount of solar panels. If your roof is simply too tiny for a sufficient array, we’ll find a different solution, such as a solar system that is put on the ground.

### **How Much Sun Light You Get**

Solar panels generate electricity by turning sunlight into electricity, and how much electricity they can generate is based on how much sunlight they receive each day. Most of the state experiences more than 300 sunny days annually. You might be able to install fewer solar panels due to the plentiful sunshine than you would require in an area with less light.

However, you should also consider the location of your home in addition to the climate. Your solar panels’ output will be impacted if there is a substantial amount of nearby shadowing from trees or structures, and you might require a larger array to counteract the shading.
