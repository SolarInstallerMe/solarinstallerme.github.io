**How to Reduce Solar Panel Installation Costs:** The installation of solar panels is a fantastic investment in your future and property. Despite this, many consumers are discouraged from adopting solar because of the upfront price and installation charges. Why, then, solar? There are a lot of long-term benefits to installing solar panels, after all.

Solar panels are not only excellent for the environment, but they can also significantly lower your utility and electricity costs. Solar energy systems can save homeowners an average of $1,100 annually, and even more for those who use a lot of energy.

You also prevent power disruptions when you have your own solar system. You won’t need the Department of Energy anymore since you’ll be consuming the energy your solar panels generate on their own.

## **How much does installing solar panels cost?**

Depending on the size of your home and where you reside, installing solar panels typically costs between $15,000 and $25,000. This is due to the fact that a typical household 5 kW system will cost between $3 and $5 per watt including installation. The rate may be considerably lower because this is before any tax breaks and incentives. Continue reading to find out how to significantly reduce the cost of installing solar panels.

### **Payment Plans**

Most solar companies provide solar loans. If the initial cost of installation is keeping you from installing, this method of financing is quite useful.

### **The Residential Solar Tax Credit**

Additionally, some states have their own solar tax incentives. You are able to deduct these tax credits from your state income tax. For instance, if your solar panel system costs up to $1,000, you may be eligible for a 25% tax credit. This will be deducted straight from your taxable personal income. You will also not be required to pay tax on any solar installation.

### **Choose a trustworthy solar company**

You should choose a reputable company for your solar installers that performs excellent work. A complete 10-year workmanship and roof guarantee is provided by JNA Solar.
