**Ways You Can Save Energy During The Winter**: Everyone wants to enjoy a warm home throughout the winter, whether they own it or rent it. But given that energy prices are much higher during the coldest season of the year, this can really drive up your electricity bill. We’ve got five energy-saving suggestions for you that will help you minimize your heating costs, use less hot water, and emit less CO2 this winter.

### **Proper Ventilation**

Even though it might resemble the “ice bucket challenge,” throwing open all of your windows will help to bring in some much-needed fresh air.

In addition to appropriately changing the air, this can reduce CO2 emissions in a single-family home by up to half a ton annually.

In order to prevent your heating from turning on during the three to four daily ventilation intervals, you should ideally close all of your heating system’s thermostatic valves. You should ideally ventilate your rooms for five minutes at a time during the colder months.

### **Do Not Waste Any Heat**

At least when it comes to heating, insulation is half the battle. Insulating drafty windows will not only help you save money and energy over time, but it will also lessen your environmental impact.

For instance, about 900 kWh or over 230 kg of CO2 might be saved annually in a single-family home (110 m2) with gas heating.

Shutters, drapes, and roller blinds can also help block off the heat at night as long as you keep them closed. As a result, 50 kg of CO2 will be saved annually and unnecessary heating bills will be avoided.

### **Energy-Efficient Heating**

People who prefer to brush their teeth in the morning and evening with warm feet frequently leave the heating on all day. The use of programmable thermostatic valves makes sense to save this from becoming an expensive ordeal. You can easily adjust the operation hours of your heating with these, saving money and, if you have a thermostatic valve with a night setback, lowering your CO2 emissions by 455 kg annually.

**Bonus Tip:** If you have a gas heating system, lowering your room’s temperature by only one hardly visible degree will also help you save up to 275 kilograms of CO2 annually
 
### **Save Hot Water**

The cost of heating includes both the actual heating and the heating of the hot water. The average amount of energy used to heat water is about 14% of overall energy use. In an average family of three people, using a low-flow shower head that consumes just 6 liters per minute rather than 14 can help you save about 37,800 liters of hot water annually and 2,550 kWh used to heat that water.

Instead of a bath, you should take a more environmentally friendly shower (using about 70 liters of water) to save on your water and heating expenses (approx. 120 liters). If you use soap, there is no need to wash your hands in warm water because thorough hand washing with cold water kills practically all germs.

### **Bleed Your Radiators**

Bleeding your radiators on a regular basis or hiring someone to do it for you will help guarantee that your heating system operates efficiently, especially during the winter. It’s time to remove the trapped air if your radiator is creating a gurgling sound or isn’t heating up despite the thermostat being set to maximum. Every air bubble wastes energy needlessly.
