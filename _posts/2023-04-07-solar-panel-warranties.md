However, there are various solar warranty types, and various installers provide various choices. It’s critical to understand what a solar panel warranty is, how it functions, and what it covers if you want to ensure that you’re obtaining the finest guarantee available.

### **What Is a Warranty on Solar Panels?**

A solar system warranty is a written assurance that, within a given time frame, any necessary repairs or replacements will be made to the covered system components. Two warranties are often included with residential and business solar panel installations:

- **Product Warranty** – The manufacturer normally upholds product warranties for solar panels, solar inverters, and solar batteries. These guarantees cover product-related issues, including production flaws or weather-related damage. Boston Solar provides an extended 25-year product warranty for solar panels and inverters.
- **Workmanship** warranties cover issues with the installation of your solar system, such as incorrect installation procedures or technician errors. The workmanship warranty offered by solar firms is ten years.

A unique production guarantee is provided by Our Solar Companies in addition to the customary product and workmanship warranties. Over the first 10 years that your system is in operation, our Generation Guarantee guarantees at least 90% energy production, or we’ll cover the difference.

### **Why Do Solar Warranties Matter?**

Warranties for solar PV panels are created to safeguard your solar system and guarantee that it will function as intended for a reasonable amount of time. You will be given comprehensive information about your warranties and what they cover when your system is installed.

Depending on whether the issue is with the product or the installation, you can make a claim to either the manufacturer or the solar company who installed your system if you suffer a problem with it during the warranty period. You will receive the replacement item and/or installation labor for free, saving you the expense of a repair, assuming the damage is covered and your claim is approved.
