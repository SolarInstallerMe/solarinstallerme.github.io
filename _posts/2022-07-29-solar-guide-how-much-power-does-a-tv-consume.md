For two reasons, knowing how many watts a TV consumes is crucial: first, you can estimate how much it will cost you, and second, you can calculate how much solar battery power you will need to keep it running in the event of a power loss.

You need to figure out how many watts a TV uses if you really must have one. Let’s determine that.

### **How much power does a TV consume?**

The wattage (W) of a TV is determined by a number of factors, including its size, what it is being used for, and the fact that TVs continue to use solar power even when they are unplugged but not in use.

A TV typically requires around 100 W of electricity, but you can find the precise number in the owner’s manual, on a label on the TV, or in the specifications sheet (which is typically available online).

You might not want to watch your new favorite Netflix series for 10 hours if you are watching TV powered by a battery during a power outage. The average storage battery has a capacity of 10 kWh, and watching TV for 10 hours would take roughly 1 kWh.

Even though it might not seem like much, while you’re using backup power, you should use less energy. Reduce your TV time instead and utilize that energy to keep the food in your refrigerator cool.

### **When turned off, do TVs still use electricity?**

Yes, TVs are in standby mode just like all other electronics.

Because it is always ready to be turned on, any plugged-in piece of technology will be using a small amount of electricity from the socket. However, maintaining electronics only requires a tiny amount of energy—less than 0.5 W of standby power.

So perhaps unplug your TV unless it is a critical load if you are facing a power outage and must rely on battery storage. Otherwise, leaving your TV plugged in won’t significantly raise your electricity bill on a typical day.

### **How do the wattages of various TV models compare?**

The type, size, and type of TV will determine how much energy it needs to operate. There are several distinct TV model types, such as LED/LCD, plasma, and smart TVs, all of which require varied wattages to operate.

We are combining LED and LCD TVs because they both operate primarily on LED lighting. A smart TV uses about the same amount of LEDs as a standard LED TV and can connect to the internet. Plasma TVs employ more LED lights than conventional LED TV.

Depending on the size and model of the TV, the normal power usage can vary. However, it is reasonable to predict that a contemporary TV will use about 100 W of power.

### **What is the cost of running a TV?**

The cost of operating a TV is not too expensive. There are 1,000 watt-hours in a kilowatt hour, and the average cost of power is approximately 13.01 cents per kWh. Therefore, you would earn that 13 cents if you watched TV for 10 hours every day.

Although this cost may change depending on your local electricity prices and how much time you spend watching TV, it is not a significant factor in your energy bill.

### **Your TV, solar power, and battery storage**

Knowing the wattage of your TV is likely only important if you need to calculate how much electricity you’ll need to run a TV using either stored energy or very little energy, such as in an RV.

Just be mindful that the energy it has saved cannot run all of your home appliances at once if you have solar storage for when the power goes out. As in, you cannot have the TV on, an electric stove cooking, the air conditioner running, and a washing machine running at the same time.

With that said, please make sure to include your TV’s wattage in your necessary load calculation if you want to use it during a power outage.

When it comes to solar panels, simply be aware that the person installing them will suggest a solar system size after taking your typical power demand into account. On our website, you may locate trustworthy solar installers who can assist you in choosing the best solar system for your particular requirements.
