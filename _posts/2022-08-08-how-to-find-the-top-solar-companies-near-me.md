### **Search for Expertise**

Spend some time getting to know each business on your list. You may rely on the top solar companies having years of expertise. An effective plan is probably already in place for an experienced team.

These teams have a higher likelihood of avoiding expensive errors. Having streamlined their processes also increases the likelihood that they will provide first-rate services.

On the other side, a new company can require more time to iron out operational issues.

Search for an “About Us” page on each company’s website. To find out when the business was started, look up their Better Business Bureau rating.

If not, find out who is coming to install your solar panels. How many properties have they already worked on? How long have they been employed by the solar panel company?

Make sure a crew working on your home has years of actual installation expertise. These teams are less likely to inflict harm or commit expensive errors.

### **Get local recommendations**

Across the US, there are presently over 19,700 solar companies that install solar panels. Using sources you can trust can help you narrow down your search. Do you know anyone in the community who already had solar panels placed on their roof?

If so, find out who they employed. Creating a list of recommendations might be made easier by talking to your friends, family, and neighbors. They could even be of assistance by offering details that aren’t available online.

Make a list of the questions you want to ask before talking to the folks in your close circle. As much information as you can regarding each homeowner’s interactions with the solar companies they chose should be gathered.

You may, for instance, ask:

- What was the price of their services?
- Which type of financing did you select?
- Do you plan to use them again?
- Did the group show there on time?
- Were they informed and skilled?
- Did the company cause you any problems?

Ask how the issue was handled if the homeowner had issues with the solar panel manufacturer. Look for a business that values its clients. For the best client experience, the finest solar providers will wish to address any problems.

It’s acceptable if you can’t get recommendations from friends and relatives. Make a list by searching for “top solar companies near me” online.

Then, check each company’s website to see if there is a testimonials section. Verify their listings on **Google My Business** and the **Better Business Bureau**. Read testimonials from clients who have walked in your shoes.

Choose a solar energy provider that has already gained the trust of the community.

Verify the qualifications of the crew installing the solar panels as well. Do they hold a solar certificate?

Request the participation of a PV installation professional in your installation project.

Knowing that someone with considerable expertise is doing your installation process will give you peace of mind.

Find out whether the solar energy providers on your list provide any extra services. For instance, they could provide yearly maintenance checkups. Regular inspections will guarantee that your solar panels are working correctly.

Additionally, the business could provide regular cleaning services.

Maybe you’re looking for services for solar battery storage. You might want to find out whether the business can provide services for roof replacement or weatherproofing as well. Your solar panel system might benefit from having a better roof.

Otherwise, spend some time getting to know the items that each solar company has to offer. A unique system can be created by some businesses.

Choose a solar company that can provide high-quality goods.

### **Think about your preferences**

Spend some time thinking about your unique wants and objectives if you want to identify the top solar installation providers. A business that meets your individual needs is the greatest one in your area.

For instance, you may choose to pick a solar panel company depending on the financing choices they offer.

Maybe you’d like to go with a local business that is better known for regional incentives. Local solar companies are probably better knowledgeable about the county’s permitting needs.

Otherwise, you could decide that a major, nationwide solar panel manufacturer is what you’d want. These businesses could provide more funding choices. They could also provide a warranty that is more extensive.

Depending on your demands and preferences, choose a company.

### **Comparing solar prices**

Get a solar quote from the top three solar energy providers on your list. Establish what is contained in the quote (such as labor and materials). Find out whether each business also offers financing solutions.
