The Top Benefits of Installing Solar Panels on Your Home: More and more households are converting to clean, renewable electricity sources as the cost of renewable energy continues to fall. Among these, a residential solar panel is among the most accessible and plentiful. 1 solar created $17 billion in investments for the U.S. economy in 2018, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

## Reasons to switch and installing solar panels in your home

### Clean and Renewable Energy

A 100 percent clean, renewable source of energy is solar power. This decreases dependency on oil, coal, and natural gas to produce electricity. These fossil fuels generate damaging emissions that impact air, water, and soil quality and are responsible for global warming. It is projected that the world will lose more plant and animal species to extinction between 2000 and 2065 than in the past 65 million years combined. 2 This is a staggering figure and one influenced dramatically by the impact of fossil fuel greenhouse gases.

Solar energy, by comparison, generates no waste. The abundant strength of the sun provides a limitless energy supply that does not degrade the landscape or harm the ozone layer. [Residential solar energy](/how-do-solar-panels-work/) systems reflect an investment in the planet’s future, the conservation of non-renewable sources of energy, and the preservation of the environment.

### Freedom and Control Over Electricity

According to findings from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S. households have experienced a steady rise in both the severity and length of power outages over the past 15 years. The United States has the highest number of power-outage minutes of any industrialized country. Our power grid is 100 years old and was not built for the greatly expanded population and severe weather events of today. The biggest utility in California, PG&amp;E, estimates that $75 billion to $150 billion will be required over many years to make the grid more stable, an expense that will be passed on to consumers.

To satisfy the growing needs of a plugged-in society, our grid needs to be remodeled. Including a home battery unit operated by residential solar panels will store ample energy over peak hours of usage to power homes, allowing households the ability to manage the electricity of their families.

The batteries, along with solar panels, are also a suitable safeguard for wildfire prevention against the rolling blackouts introduced by electric utilities. Today’s antiquated grid ensures that power outages can occur even in areas not directly affected by wildfires.

With a household solar system, your home is operated during the day by rooftop solar panels and at night by energy stored in the battery. You achieve energy independence by installing solar panels.

It is becoming more affordable, available, durable, and reliable for solar panels and home batteries. When the power goes out or the next storm hits, they provide comfort and energy protection for households. Sunrun’s Brightbox home battery system replenishes with energy produced from the sun and eliminates the hassle, complexity, and cost of refueling a gas or diesel-powered generator.

### Saving Money

Home solar panels will cover your bills if you’re facing rising home energy expenses.

On cloudy days, savings can also accrue because the sun emits energy through bright and cloudy skies. Also, in colder, cloudier climates, solar provides year-round productivity and savings. Some solar panels potentially produce more energy than your home absorbs, depending on their scale, performance, and orientation relative to the sun. This will reduce your energy bill per month to zero.

### Qualifying for Tax Breaks

The availability of federal, state, and local tax cuts is another factor in the growing affordability of solar panels. The federal solar tax credit offers you a dollar-for-dollar cut against your federal income tax for analysis. The residential federal solar tax credit already provides you with a dollar-for-dollar reduction against your federal income tax similar to 26 percent of the final cost of your home’s solar energy systems. Via December 31, 2022, this advantage exists. The residential tax credit will decrease to 22 percent in 2023. In 2024, the residential solar tax credit will end.

In fact, the residential solar panels you purchase will increase your home’s selling price. Homes with solar energy systems sell 4.1 percent more on median than comparable homes without solar power. That converts to an additional $9,274 for the median-valued home.

### Price Decrease

In past years, the price of solar has fallen significantly, dropping more than 70 percent in just the last decade. You can also save money on repairs, as there are no components to break down. Furthermore, the cost of home solar batteries has also fallen significantly.

The time to switch is now. You can…
