You should know a little bit about how solar panels work to understand how much solar power is generated per square foot and the[ Factors that Affect Your Total Solar Panel Installation Cost](/factors-that-affect-your-total-solar-panel-installation-cost/). Solar panels work by allowing particles of light, called photons, to knock electrons from their atomic orbitals. A flow of electricity is produced when this takes place, and this electricity is harnessed and stored as electrical energy. This all occurs when a device called a photovoltaic cell is struck by light.

Hundreds of thousands of these cells are made up of solar panels, and many solar panels make up a solar array. These arrays are connected to the current electrical grid so that it is possible to properly direct the produced electricity.

### **_What generates the most electricity from a solar panel?_**

You will need to decide how much electricity you currently use and that will translate into the amount and type of solar panels you want to install in your photovoltaic (PV) solar system in order to generate the energy necessary to power your home or company. A solar panel has to be well built to manage temperature, spectrum, angle, and amount of light to generate the maximum amount of power per square foot.

**_Spectrum_**

It’s true that solar panels turn visible light into electricity. But thanks to the light spectrum that includes infrared and ultraviolet as well as the light visible to the human eye, even on cloudy days, solar panels can still develop electricity. Solar panels that can absorb more infrared and ultraviolet light are capable of generating more energy.

**_Light Amount_**

Since the number of light rays that hit your solar panels is a vital factor in energy generation, solar installers take great care to install your panels away from the shade of trees and leaves, as well as away from dust or other obstacles that can block light. When estimating the electricity produced by your solar system, the weather patterns at your location are considered.

**_Angle_**

The power provided by solar panels also depends on both the angle facing the sun from your roof and the angle of the sun itself. Although the surface of your roof does not shift, the sun does so as the earth rotates around the sun on its axis. Such considerations make each solar installation unique. The solar panels are made with anti-reflective glass that allows the rays of the sun to bounce back into the solar cell, harnessing even more energy.

**_Temperatures_**

It’s not hot temperatures that prevent the highest energy levels from generating solar panels. In fact, the panels produce less energy when temperatures are higher than about 78 degrees. Our solar panels are, however, designed with a low-temperature coefficient that helps to minimize these losses.

### **_How many solar panels do you need to produce power?_**

Solar panel systems, a measure of electrical power equal to **_1000 watts_**, are measured in terms of **_kilowatts (kW)_**. Typically, a common solar panel array size is about **_5-6kW_** and takes up around 400 square feet of space. An average of **_350-850 kWh_** of AC (alternating current) energy per month can be provided by an array of this scale. A typical household uses around **_898 kWh_** per month. Solar installers will decide how much power you need and build a solar system for your home or business that includes the best configuration of panels to suit your electrical energy needs, taking into account the above factors.
